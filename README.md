# Overview
Adds support for ```.flowchart```, ```.sequence```, ```.dot```, and ```.railroad``` to Atom. Each has is a text DSL based format that
is easy to edit and generates a corresponding .SVG file.

**NOTE**: Only ```.flowchart``` is currently supported, as I haven't integrated all of the **diagram** package diagrams.

# Documentation
See underlying [diagrams](https://github.com/francoislaberge/diagrams) project for syntax details.
